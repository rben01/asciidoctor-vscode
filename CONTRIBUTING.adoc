== Updating The Grammar

This package now uses the {uri-atom-textmate-language}[Atom language package] to generate a grammar.

This can be updated manually using the following process:

. Install the `cson` npm package
+
  npm install --global cson

. Retrieve and convert the grammar:
+
[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
curl {uri-atom-textmate-language-raw} | cson2json > ./syntaxes/Asciidoctor.json

. Now manually edit and change the scope name from:
+
[source,json]
"scopeName": "source.asciidoc",
+
to
+
[source,json]
"scopeName": "text.asciidoc",

Because this package has diverged slightly from upstream it may be best to cherry-pick commits after the original conversion or do before/after comparisons and account for each change.

Where possible it is recommended to do PRs upstream and then use that result here.
